🚀 Real-Time Email/SMS Spam Classifier Web App
This project is a real-time spam classification web application that predicts whether a given message is spam or not spam using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is built with Python, trained using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, and uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. The web interface is created using Streamlit and is deployed on Render for live usage.

🧠 Features
🔍 Real-time Prediction of SMS or Email messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam".

💬 Simple and clean user interface built with Streamlit.

🧹 Preprocessing of text using NLTK: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming.

📊 Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer from sklearn.

🚀 Deployed on Render for easy access and instant predictions.

✅ Lightweight model trained on a reliable dataset, providing quick and accurate results.
